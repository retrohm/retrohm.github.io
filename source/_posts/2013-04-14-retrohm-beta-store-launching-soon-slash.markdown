We are soon going to be launching a beta version of our online
storefront. We have made our first medium run board order and will have
three different boards available for the beta launch. The goal with the
beta launch will be to see how our Spree plugins work and gather
feedback from customers. A secondary goal will be to sell and ship some
boards and basically tune all of our processes in preparation for a
general launch.

The products we will be offering up in the beta launch will be a
Raspberry Pi Status LCD, a RGB LED Rotary Encoder, and a NES uJoypad.
All boards are designed, assembled, and tested in-house, are RoHS
compliant, and are open source hardware.
